# CPP Module 02

Implementation of a custom fixed-point number class:
- Overloading arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
- Comparison operators (`<`, `>`, `==`, etc.)
- Pre and post increment/decrement operators
- Static methods for `min` and `max`

Goal: Understand operator overloading and class utility functions while simulating fixed-point precision.
