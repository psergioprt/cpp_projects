# 42 C++ Modules

A series of 5 progressively challenging modules designed to teach C++ and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) from the ground up.  
Each module introduces and builds on core concepts like memory management, classes, inheritance, polymorphism, abstract interfaces, and operator overloading.

Developed in a Linux environment, compiled with `clang++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++98`.
