# ðŸ§© 42 C++ Modules

A series of progressively challenging projects designed to teach **C++** and **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** from the ground up.  
Each module builds on the previous one, covering concepts such as **memory management, inheritance, polymorphism, abstract interfaces, operator overloading, templates**, and the **STL**.

Developed and tested in a **Linux environment**, compiled with:  
`clang++ -Wall -Wextra -Werror -std=c++98`
